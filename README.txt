Implementation of a simple project framework for building up from here.
PIPELINE:
1. Feature generator
2. Feature encoding
3. feature importance
1. data_split
2. baseline: baseline with linear algorithms
3. baseline_ensemble: baseline with ensemble  algorithms
4. model_tuning
5. learning_curves
5. validation
6. Ensembles: Voting Classifier with the best models
6. predictions: predict using test set and different configurations (average, single, etc)
