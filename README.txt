Implementation of a simple project framework for building up from here.
PIPELINE:
1. Feature generator
2. Feature encoding (here train and test are rescaled separately)
3. feature selection/importance
4. data_split
5. baseline unified: baseline with linear and ensemble algorithms
6. model_tuning
7. learning_curves
8. validation
9. Ensembles: Voting Classifier with the best models
10. predictions: predict using test set and different configurations (average, single, etc)
11. ensemble predict
12.submit 
13. ensemble submit
